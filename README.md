### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a proactive entrepreneur at heart who constantly seeks new challenges. As an Architect who codes, I have broadened my skill set through a passion for technology and innovation. 

Technology is the future of architecture and the built world. Always learning and leveraging cutting-edge technologies to seek answers, I bring a holistic approach when facing new challengesâ€”involved in BIM, architecture, and software products, projects, and implementations across scales, from design automation to full-fledged apps in several countries. 

With experience founding my own startups, I enjoy participating in every aspect of the business and design process, thanks to my broad background and interests. I'm passionate about design & technology, especially about finding common ground between the two.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several challenging projects at [e-verse](www.e-verse.com), doing my best to help the company grow in any way I can.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some smart contract coding in my free time. I have some repos about that here.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related to innovation in the BIM/AEC industries. Feel free to reach out!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about coding for architects: BIM, Dynamo, Python, C#.
- ðŸ¤˜ I have a few side projects as part of [Radical Labs](https://radical-labs.co/), where we develop digital experiences oriented towards extreme sports and related communities.
